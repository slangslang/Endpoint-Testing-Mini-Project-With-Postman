# 🛠️ Endpoint Testing Mini Project with Postman

## 🌟 Project Overview

I'm excited to share my completed project on **Endpoint Testing Mini with Postman**! 🚀 In this project, I delved into the fundamentals of API testing using **Postman**, a powerful tool for making HTTP requests and validating API responses. I explored CRUD operations on a student database, and everything about this project can be found in this repository.

### A Special Shoutout! 🎉
A huge thank you to [DevMountain](https://github.com/DevMountain) for providing yet another fantastic free live endpoint testing project! Be sure to check out their repository: [Endpoint Testing Mini](https://github.com/DevMountain/endpoint-testing-mini).

I invite you to explore the details of my project and see how I tackled this mini endpoint testing with Postman. Let’s get started! 💪

## 🛠️ Setup and Environment Configuration
- **Forked and cloned** the repository to get started.
- **Installed all necessary dependencies** to set up the project.
- **Launched the server locally**, ensuring the API was up and running smoothly.

Once the environment was ready, I imported the provided Postman collection and began testing the API endpoints.

## 📊 Key Accomplishments

<details>
<summary>Click to Expand: Fetching Students Using Various Filters</summary>

I created and ran tests to fetch students using several filters:
- **By ID**: Retrieved a specific student based on their unique ID.
- **By Email**: Validated fetching students by email.
- **By Name**: Tested retrieving students by name.
- **By Grade**: Confirmed retrieval based on grade level.
- **By Phone**: Filtered students by their phone number.

Each test was successful, demonstrating correct API responses!

<details>
<summary>Click to Expand: Updating a Student’s Grade</summary>

I tested updating a student’s grade, ensuring the API accurately reflected the change. The new data was confirmed when fetching the student again.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Click to Expand: Adding a New Student</summary>

I tested the **Create** functionality by adding a new student to the system. After sending the request, I verified that the student was properly added and could be fetched.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Click to Expand: Removing a Student</summary>

For the **Delete** operation, I confirmed that after the delete request, the student was no longer available in the database.

## 🔍 Testing and Validation

<details>
<summary>Click to Expand: Testing and Validation Details</summary>

Throughout the project, I created various tests to ensure the API worked as intended:
- **Status Code Verification**: Validated correct HTTP status codes (e.g., 200 OK, 201 Created).
- **Response Data Validation**: Checked response data for accuracy.
- **API Behavior**: Ensured proper handling of edge cases (e.g., student not found).
</details>

## 🎯 Final Outcome
At the end of this project, I ran the entire Postman collection and successfully passed all tests, confirming that the API functioned correctly for all CRUD operations. This project provided valuable hands-on experience in:
- API testing using Postman
- Performing full CRUD operations
- Validating response data and API behavior
- Writing and running automated tests
